* Proprietary Recommendations

- Almost impossible not to use at least some proprietary software.
- Be wary of high switching costs.
- Avoid proprietary file formats and exchange protocols whenever possible.
- Keep copies of your data in your control.
- Consider diverse collaborators across long ranges of space and time.
- Discover alternatives so you always have a way out if necessary.
- If a platform gets too shitty, pay the switching costs and move!
