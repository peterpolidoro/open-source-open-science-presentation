Cory Doctorow 2022 blog post: "Social Quitting"

Pattern in which products and services decline in quality over time.

1. Companies offer quality products for free or at a reduced cost to attract
   users.
2. Degrade user offerings to benefit suppliers, advertisers, and business
   customers.
3. Quality and support deteriorate and/or prices increase to maximize profit.
